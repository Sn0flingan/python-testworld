# python-testworld
A test repository to learn all about Python and Git in one big sitting. 

## Moving in the reposotory
This is some useful lines to use:
change branch called branchname: git checkout branchname
create new branch: git checkout -b newbranch
to get info: git status

## Commits
When you made a change you want to save:
1. Open git gui (type git gui in terminal)
2. Stage changes
3. Commit them.
(NOTE: this only makes changes in your branch, not the master)

## Merging
When you feel that your code is done and the branch task is finnished
you should merge. But before we merge it is good to get the opinions of 
someone else in the group. This is done by creating a pull-request.
A pull-resquest is basically asking someone to "proof" read your code.
The pull-request is done in github. When you got enough answers sort out the mergeing in github space.
